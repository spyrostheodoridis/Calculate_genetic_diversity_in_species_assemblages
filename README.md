This repository contains the basic functions we used to estimate genetic diversity in the manuscript "Evolutionary history and past climate change shape genetic diversity in terrestrial mammals". The manuscript is currently under review for <em>Nature Communications</em>. The functions and worflow are contained in two Jupyter Notebooks and can be downloaded and run interactively given that the users have already the required input files (i.e. georeferenced and aligned genetic sequences). These data will be become available upon acceptance of the manuscript both through this repository and through a web-based interactive data explorer.
